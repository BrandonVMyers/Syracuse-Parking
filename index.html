        <h2>Why is this topic important?</h2>
        <p>Parking is an activity many people can take for granted. Finding a good parking spot is not something that many people are thinking of 24/7 but it can make the difference between being late to a date or even an exam and could lead to unfavorable consequences. When a person wants to avoid these consequences they may end up committing a parking violation. Parking violations can range from a person parking in a no stopping zone to overtime parking. Taking a look at the number of parking violations in a given city or street could not only provide insight on to what extent the people of the city respect the rules, but also on the city's performance in keeping parking ready and available.</p>

        <h3>How I got the data?</h3>
        <p>The data was sourced from Open Data Syracuse, a website run by the Syracuse Government. The collected data from 2023 tracked parking violations up to only March, so I only used data from 2022 up until March. While this may exclude many other parking violations from 2022, it also allows us to accurately compare 2022 and 2023 without having to worry about data that was not up-to-date. While there were some outliers within the 2023 data such as parking tickets to be issued in the future, they were not taken into account during the analysis because they did not represent data from the whole month. When looking at Syracuse streets, I only chose streets that either are very popular and are closely associated with Syracuse University, or streets that are known to have a lot of student housing. Picking specific streets such as these can reveal issues that spread across campus and not just on these streets. </p>

        <h4>Student Housing</h4>
        <p>One street that saw a notable increase in parking violations was Euclid Avenue. Not only does Euclid Avenue connect right into Syracuse University, but it also contains a lot of student housing. Based on the increase in parking violations on the avenue. A conclusion can be made that more student parking is necessary on the avenue or less students should be allowed to live in each house in order to prevent more traffic. Student housing has become a serious issue as the University has accepted more students than it can handle. This has led to students living in the Sheraton Hotel or even going into the summer break without knowing if they will have housing for the fall. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-sm take1">
        <h4>Student Transportation</h4>
        <p>One street that saw a decrease in parking violations was University Avenue. While University Avenue does have a parking garage it is also important to note that many students don't need to park on University Avenue. Both the Whitman School of business and Marshall Square Mall are within walking distance from the main campus. Syracuse University also provides transportation to these destinations through the Syracuse Trolley which makes numerous stops on University Avenue. Veo Scooters, which are a popular transportation for students going short distances, also expanded in Syracuse in late March of 2022 (<a href="https://www.syr.gov/News/2022/City-News/2022-03-28-City-News">For more information</a>).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-sm take1">
        <h4>Student Parking</h4>
        <p>Another Syracuse Street that underwent an increase in parking violations was Waverly Avenue. While Waverly Avenue does not have any student housing besides Watson Hall, it does have the Schine Student Center, Bird Library, and the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. Despite the fact that Waverly Avenue is not that big of a street, it still had 503 parking violations in 2023 and has the second most parking violations out of all the analyzed streets. Syracuse University should improve parking availability on Waverly Avenue or at the academic buildings located on the street.</p>

        <h4>2022 vs 2023</h4>
        <p>The trend in parking violations throughout the first three months of 2023 is almost directly opposite to the trend from the first three months of 2022. By the end of the first three months of the year, 2023 saw a decrease of 2,012 parking violations. Meanwhile, during the same time span, 2022 saw an increase of 2,288 parking violations. So what changed between 2022 and 2023? Assistant Professor of Urban Policy Austin Zwick gives credit to an app called Flowbird which was allowed in Syracuse in the fall. The app not only lets people pay for parking but also reminds people when parking is about to expire and allows for time extension.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>While the number of parking violations in Syracuse may make it seem like the city is not doing a good job making parking available, the trends in the data make it seem like Syracuse has done a great job in preventing parking violations. As new technologies such as VEO and Flowbird become readily available in the city, the amount of parking violations will likely decrease. Looking at the parking violation data of streets around Syracuse University revealed that many students may struggle with parking and that the University should place more importance into parking at important academic buildings.</p>
